    "Sol:  Statistics in data science is the practice of collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data to make informed decisions. It involves using mathematical techniques to summarize and interpret data, identify patterns and trends, and make predictions based on the available information. Statistics plays a crucial role in data science by providing the tools and methods to understand and derive insights from large and complex datasets. It helps data scientists to draw meaningful conclusions and make data-driven decisions.\n"
